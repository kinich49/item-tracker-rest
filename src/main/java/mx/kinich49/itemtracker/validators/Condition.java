 * A condition is any business rule, requirement, or demand

 * If the parameter is not valid (as it didn't satisfy the business rule),
 * then the Optional must return an appropriate error code and error message
 * <p>
 * As an example, when adding a new CommercialEstablishment,
 * the new instance is "valid" if its name is unique in
 * the database (case-insensitive)
 * <p>
 * That's one business rule, encapsulated in its own
 * Condition implementation
 * <p>
 * It might occur a condition is considered a "gatekeeper", as in,
 * if that condition is not met, then all other consecutive
 * conditions should not even be executed.
 * <p>
 * For example, a Request to add a CommercialEstablishment has
 * a condition the request must not be null. If this condition
 * is not satisfied, then other conditions should not be tested
 * as they might cause errors.
